# About this repository

This is a simple boilerplate code for running Node.js environment with TypeScript and unit testing using Jest.

It comes with a linter, a formatter, Nodemon for live code change monitoring, and Dot Env for environmental variables.
I try to keep all the packages up to date.

This template is very opinionated, but it works for most projects that I work on.
